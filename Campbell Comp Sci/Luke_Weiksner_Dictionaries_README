Determines the top ten most used words in both Trump and Harris' speeches

The file takes in two text files to be taken in to be cleaned and sorted.
  It takes the two text files with the speeches and then puts it to all lower case, removes punctuation, and sorts the words in ascending order in a dictionary. Then the top ten words are put into a csv file and put into matplotlib for a pie chart.

It requires a or multiple text file to be read.
